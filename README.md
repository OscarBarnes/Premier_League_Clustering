# Premier League Stratification Audit
**A Multivariate Analysis using R (PCA & K-Means Clustering)**

## Project Overview
This project quantifies the structural divide in the Premier League. Instead of looking at the league table, I used 10+ financial and sporting variables to define the true 'Competitive Tiers' of English football.

## Key Findings
* **The Financial Chasm:** A 1.91-unit gap separates the 'Big Six' from the rest of the league.
* **The Vanguard Tier:** Identified a group of high-efficiency clubs (e.g., Brighton, Aston Villa) that outperform their financial scale.
* **The Scale Gap:** Quantified the exact percentage of growth required for clubs like Everton (88.82%) to reach the Elite core.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** R
* **Libraries:** `tidyverse`, `factoextra`, `cluster`, `ggplot2`
* **Methods:** Z-Score Normalization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means Clustering.
